# NixSkill

Personal dotfiles for Home-Manager and NixOS using [flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes).

## Structure

modules: NixOS common configs
hosts: host-specific configuration
scripts: Common scripts files

## How to use

I don't recommend using the configuration off the shelf. clone it, get ideas, and copy codes from it.
Don't forget to update variables defined inside [flake.nix](https://github.com/ASafaeirad/NixSkill/blob/main/flake.nix).
