# NixSkill

Personal dotfiles for Home-Manager and NixOS using [flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes).

## Structure

modules: NixOS common configs
hosts: host-specific configuration
scripts: Common scripts files

## How to use

I don't recommend to use the configuration off-the-shelf, clone it, get ideas and copy codes from it.
